# BLCMM_Plugins
The repo where all my BLCMM plugins are stored. Serves as an example for aspiring plugin developers.
Data packages and libraries are ignored, and won't be found on this repo.
The data packages required for each plugin is listed in the main class of the plugin, and the libraries are the same as those used by the main BLCMM app.
